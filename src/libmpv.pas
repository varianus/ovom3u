  {
   * Note: the client API is licensed under ISC (see above) to ease
   * interoperability with other licenses. But keep in mind that the
   * mpv core is still mostly GPLv2+. It's up to lawyers to decide
   * whether applications using this API are affected by the GPL.
   * One argument against this is that proprietary applications
   * using mplayer in slave mode is apparently tolerated, and this
   * API is basically equivalent to slave mode.
    }
 {*
   * Mechanisms provided by this API
   * -------------------------------
   *
   * This API provides general control over mpv playback. It does not give you
   * direct access to individual components of the player, only the whole thing.
   * It's somewhat equivalent to MPlayer's slave mode. You can send commands,
   * retrieve or set playback status or settings with properties, and receive
   * events.
   *
   * The API can be used in two ways:
   * 1) Internally in mpv, to provide additional features to the command line
   *    player. Lua scripting uses this. (Currently there is no plugin API to
   *    get a client API handle in external user code. It has to be a fixed
   *    part of the player at compilation time.)
   * 2) Using mpv as a library with mpv_create(). This basically allows embedding
   *    mpv in other applications.
   *
   * Event loop
   * ----------
   *
   * In general, the API user should run an event loop in order to receive events.
   * This even loop should call mpv_wait_event(), which will return once a new
   * mpv client API is available. It should also be possible to integrate client
   * API usage in other event loops (e.g. GUI toolkits) with the
   * mpv_set_wakeup_callback() function, and then polling for events by calling
   * mpv_wait_event() with a 0 timeout.
   *
   * Note that the event loop is detached from the actual player. Not calling
   * mpv_wait_event() will not stop playback. It will eventually congest the
   * event queue of your API handle, though.
   *
   * Synchronous vs. asynchronous calls
   * ----------------------------------
   *
   * The API allows both synchronous and asynchronous calls. Synchronous calls
   * have to wait until the playback core is ready, which currently can take
   * an unbounded time (e.g. if network is slow or unresponsive). Asynchronous
   * calls just queue operations as requests, and return the result of the
   * operation as events.
   *
   * Asynchronous calls
   * ------------------
   *
   * The client API includes asynchronous functions. These allow you to send
   * requests instantly, and get replies as events at a later point. The
   * requests are made with functions carrying the _async suffix, and replies
   * are returned by mpv_wait_event() (interleaved with the normal event stream).
   *
   * A 64 bit userdata value is used to allow the user to associate requests
   * with replies. The value is passed as reply_userdata parameter to the request
   * function. The reply to the request will have the reply
   * mpv_event->reply_userdata field set to the same value as the
   * reply_userdata parameter of the corresponding request.
   *
   * This userdata value is arbitrary and is never interpreted by the API. Note
   * that the userdata value 0 is also allowed, but then the client must be
   * careful not accidentally interpret the mpv_event->reply_userdata if an
   * event is not a reply. (For non-replies, this field is set to 0.)
   *
   * Currently, asynchronous calls are always strictly ordered (even with
   * synchronous calls) for each client, although that may change in the future.
   *
   * Multithreading
   * --------------
   *
   * The client API is generally fully thread-safe, unless otherwise noted.
   * Currently, there is no real advantage in using more than 1 thread to access
   * the client API, since everything is serialized through a single lock in the
   * playback core.
   *
   * Basic environment requirements
   * ------------------------------
   *
   * This documents basic requirements on the C environment. This is especially
   * important if mpv is used as library with mpv_create().
   *
   * - The LC_NUMERIC locale category must be set to "C". If your program calls
   *   setlocale(), be sure not to use LC_ALL, or if you do, reset LC_NUMERIC
   *   to its sane default: setlocale(LC_NUMERIC, "C").
   * - If a X11 based VO is used, mpv will set the xlib error handler. This error
   *   handler is process-wide, and there's no proper way to share it with other
   *   xlib users within the same process. This might confuse GUI toolkits.
   * - mpv uses some other libraries that are not library-safe, such as Fribidi
   *   (used through libass), LittleCMS, ALSA, FFmpeg, and possibly more.
   * - The FPU precision must be set at least to double precision.
   * - On Windows, mpv will call timeBeginPeriod(1).
   * - On memory exhaustion, mpv will kill the process.
   *
   * Embedding the video window
   * --------------------------
   *
   * Currently you have to get the raw window handle, and set it as "wid" option.
   * This works on X11 and win32 only. In addition, it works with a few VOs only,
   * and VOs which do not support this will just create a freestanding window.
   *
   * Both on X11 and win32, the player will fill the window referenced by the
   * "wid" option fully and letterbox the video (i.e. add black bars if the
   * aspect ratio of the window and the video mismatch).
   *
   * On OSX, embedding is not yet possible, because Cocoa makes this non-trivial.
    }
  {*
   * The version is incremented on each API change. The 16 lower bits form the
   * minor version number, and the 16 higher bits the major version number. If
   * the API becomes incompatible to previous versions, the major version
   * number is incremented. This affects only C part, and not properties and
   * options.

 * Create a new mpv instance and an associated client API handle to control

 * and needs to be initialized to be actually used with most other API
 * functions.
 *
 * Some API functions will return MPV_ERROR_UNINITIALIZED in the uninitialized
 * state. You can call mpv_set_property() (or mpv_set_property_string() and
 * other variants, and before mpv 0.21.0 mpv_set_option() etc.) to set initial
 * options. After this, call mpv_initialize() to start the player, and then use
 * e.g. mpv_command() to start playback of a file.
 *
 * The point of separating handle creation and actual initialization is that
 * you can configure things which can't be changed during runtime.
 *
 * Unlike the command line player, this will have initial settings suitable
 * for embedding in applications. The following settings are different:
 * - stdin/stdout/stderr and the terminal will never be accessed. This is
 *   equivalent to setting the --no-terminal option.
 *   (Technically, this also suppresses C signal handling.)
 * - No config files will be loaded. This is roughly equivalent to using
 *   --config=no. Since libmpv 1.15, you can actually re-enable this option,
 *   which will make libmpv load config files during mpv_initialize(). If you
 *   do this, you are strongly encouraged to set the "config-dir" option too.
 *   (Otherwise it will load the mpv command line player's config.)
 *   For example:
 *      mpv_set_option_string(mpv, "config-dir", "/my/path"); // set config root
 *      mpv_set_option_string(mpv, "config", "yes"); // enable config loading
 *      (call mpv_initialize() _after_ this)
 * - Idle mode is enabled, which means the playback core will enter idle mode
 *   if there are no more files to play on the internal playlist, instead of
 *   exiting. This is equivalent to the --idle option.
 * - Disable parts of input handling.
 * - Most of the different settings can be viewed with the command line player
 *   by running "mpv --show-profile=libmpv".
 *
 * All this assumes that API users want a mpv instance that is strictly
 * isolated from the command line player's configuration, user settings, and
 * so on. You can re-enable disabled features by setting the appropriate
 * options.
 *
 * The mpv command line parser is not available through this API, but you can
 * set individual options with mpv_set_property(). Files for playback must be

 * read all contents of the pipe and then call mpv_wait_event(c, 0) until
 * no new events are returned. The pipe contents do not matter and can just
 * be discarded. There is not necessarily one byte per readable event in the
